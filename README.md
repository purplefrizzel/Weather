# Weather API

This is a simple weather API written in Java, the data comes from the BBC Weather's undocumented API.

## Documentation

There are some Swagger docs [here](https://pf-weather-testing.herokuapp.com/api/docs/).

## Tech

The API was written in Java and uses the dropwizard framework, this was picked because I wanted to try it out and After using it, I wasn't a complete fan.
I may do a rewrite in Spring Boot or ASP.NET Core.

## What is this

This API was written mostly for fun, I have never tried it in a real application but you can if you want, it is free but some credit would be nice :).

## Testing site

The testing site can be found [here](https://pf-weather-testing.herokuapp.com/api/docs/), it gets updated when ever a new PR is pulled to the `main` branch.
